# JeopardyGameProject

Code: https://github.com/namanagar/Jeopardy

Project description: 

This project is a simulation of the popular game show, Jeopardy. Jeopardy is a quiz-based game show where contestants pick from a board of categories with different prize money amounts and answer the question given. The prize money amounts usually correlate with the difficulty level of the question (more money = harder question). For this project you are able to play with 2-4 players and the turns are alternating, no matter if you answer the question correctly or not, unlike actual Jeopardy. You are able to select from the board which category and dollar amount you want as long as it is available. Then you are given 20 seconds to type in your answer. In this version, they list 4 options for answers, also unlike the actual Jeopardy game. 


Educational goals: 

This project will incorporate object oriented design, test driven development, unified modeling language, and debugging. It could incorporate a graphical user interface, though I do not have the skills to achieve this. 



My contributions: 

My proposed contribution is to make this game a bit better. The programmers behind this project did a fantastic job at creating this game, but I have some ideas on how to tweak it. I want this to be a 1-4 player game. I think this game could be enjoyable to someone just wanting to answer quiz questions. I also think there should be a bigger board with more questions (it currently is only 3x4). I would also want to somehow change up the categories each time they play. Another idea would be to create a full game with a Jeopardy round, a Double Jeopardy round, and a Final Jeopardy round, just like the real game show. I also think an element to increase the difficulty of the game would be to remove giving the players op
